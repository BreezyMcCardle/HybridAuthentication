# API Keys and User Authentication in ArcGIS

This sample code showcases the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, only accessing basemaps from ArcGIS Location Platform through an API Key, and a user's ArcGIS Online account using User Authentication.

For users with an existing ArcGIS account, the code demonstrates how to seamlessly switch to using their ArcGIS license for accessing basemaps, eliminating the need for an API Key. By enabling existing Esri users to sign in with their ArcGIS accounts, you do not need to monitor usage and manage costs associated with API Keys.

Please feel free to use this example code as a foundation and expand upon it with your own application code.
